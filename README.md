# WarTech

**Logo Goes Here**

In 2022 mankind took its first tenative step to becoming an advanced civilization when for the first time a fusion reaction was created that resulted in net power generation.

In 2615 the second step occured when an experiment at the Mare Ingenii Large Hadron Collider caused the entire facility and a large portion of the surrounding landscape to vaporize.  It wasn't until 2629 however when another team of scientests was reviewing the archival data and readings from that failed experiement that they figured out that the experiment had actually resulted in the creation of an artificial wormhole that sent everything in the event area to parts unknown.

By 2930 manking had connected all the dots and spread to multiple star systems travelling between them as routinely as travelling from country to country.

As has always happened though, we also found a way to use our new found power to kill one another more efficiently than ever before.

Massive warships capable of leaping dozens of light years at a time patrol the borders between warring empires each equipped with the power to glass an entire planet.

Giant humanoid robots known as MECs (Mechanized Exoskelton Combat Unit) bristling with weapons and armor scorch and stomp anything in their way.

Border skirmishes are common as empires constantly probe one another for weaknesses in a never ending quest for wealth and power.  This chaotic mix has lead to the rise of armies-for-hire allowing each empire to try and achieve their goals without being held accountable for the blood shed.

This is the world of WarTech.  Fight for one of the established militaries, throw your lot in with one of the existing armies-for-hire, or plot your own course and run your own mercanry company.  The future is yours.  Become a legend or die on a backwater planet no one has ever heard of.

**Luck, fate, and guts are all that stand between you and glory.**
